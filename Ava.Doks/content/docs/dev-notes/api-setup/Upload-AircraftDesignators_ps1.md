This script is used to **ingest aircraft type designator data** from a public CSV file into a local API database. The CSV file is auto-generated weekly by a GitHub Action that scrapes [Wikipedia‚Äôs aircraft type designators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_type_designators) and saves a clean version to the repository.

The PowerShell script performs the following tasks:

- Downloads the CSV file from the `main` branch of the GitHub repo.
- Parses each line as a CSV row into a PowerShell object.
- For each record:
  - Creates a JSON payload following the API contract.
  - Excludes empty fields (`icao_code`, `iata_type_code`, `wikipedia_link`) to avoid sending nulls where they‚Äôre not required.
  - Sends the object to the API via a `POST` request to `http://localhost:5165/api/v1/wikipedia/aircrafttypedesignators`.
- Adds a small delay between each POST (`100ms`) to avoid overwhelming the local API.

This is useful for bootstrapping or syncing the Wikipedia aircraft data into your own application database, particularly when onboarding new environments or refreshing data as part of a nightly job.

```pwsh
# Define the CSV URL and target API endpoint
$csvUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/repasscloud/AircraftTypeDesignatorScraper/refs/heads/main/aircraft_type_designators.csv"
$apiEndpoint = "http://localhost:5165/api/v1/wikipedia/aircrafttypedesignators"

# Download CSV content

    exit 1
}

# Convert CSV string to objects

$csv = $csvContent.Content | ConvertFrom-Csv

# Loop through each row and send as POST (throttled)
foreach ($row in $csv) {

    # Convert to JSON

    catch {
