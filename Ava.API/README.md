# How to Use

## Generate A Client

- Create the client first, this will produce a ClientID and a default policy
- Update the policy by the policy name (which will be the client's name and Default Policy text)
- A default policy will have access to all locations, etc., it won't be restrictive, this has to be done after the fact by the admin of the company
